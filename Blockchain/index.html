        <dd>A blockchain, originally block chain, is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks,
          which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash pointer
          as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are
          inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can
          record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".
          For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network
          collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any
          given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks,
          which requires collusion of the network majority.

      History
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and
      W. Scott Stornetta.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first blockchain was conceptualised by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto in
      2008. It was implemented the following year as a core component of the digital currency bitcoin,
      where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network. By using a blockchain,
      bitcoin became the first digital currency to solve the double spending problem without requiring
      a trusted administrator and has been the inspiration for many additional applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term blockchain 2.0 refers to new applications of the distributed blockchain database, first emerging
      in 2014. Blockchain 2.0 technologies go beyond transactions and enable "exchange of value without
      powerful intermediaries acting as arbiters of money and information". They are expected to allow
      people to "monetize their own information", to store an individual's "persistent digital ID and
      persona" and are providing an avenue to help solve the problem of social inequality by potentially
      changing the way wealth is distributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has the potential to create new foundations for our economic and social systems". They further predicted
      that, while foundational innovations can have enormous impact, "It will take decades for blockchain
      to seep into our economic and social infrastructure."
    </p>

    <h2 id="Structure">
      Structure
    </h2>
    <p>
      A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions
      across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration
      of all subsequent blocks and the collusion of the network. A blockchain database is managed autonomously
      using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass
      collaboration powered by collective self-interests.
      <br /> A blockchain can assign title rights because it provides a record that compels offer and
      acceptance.

          Blocks
        </h3>
        <p>
          Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree. Each block
          includes the hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks
          form a chain.

        <h3>
          Block time
        </h3>
        <p>
          The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain.
          In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the money transaction takes place, so a shorter
          block time means faster transactions. The block time for ether is set to between 14 and 15
          seconds, while for bitcoin it is 10 minutes.

        <h3>
          Forks
        </h3>
        <p>
          A hard fork term refers to a situation when a blockchain splits into two separate chains in consequence
          of the use of two distinct sets of rules trying to govern the system. Hard forks are not backwards
          compatible, but a soft fork, a smaller change is.

    <h2 id="Concepts">
      Decentralization
    </h2>
    <p>
      By storing data across its network, the blockchain eliminates the risks that come with data being held
      centrally. Its network lacks centralized points of vulnerability that computer crackers can exploit;
      likewise, it has no central point of failure. While centralized data is more controllable, information
      and data manipulation are common. By decentralizing it, blockchain makes data transparent to everyone
      involved.
      <br /> Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as proof-of-work, to serialize changes.
      Alternate consensus methods include proof-of-stake.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Openness
    </h2>
    <p>
      Open blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to
      the public, still require physical access to view.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Permissionless
    </h2>
    <p>
      The great advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against
      bad actors is not required and no access control is needed. This means that applications can be
      added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a transport
      layer.

          General potentials
        </h3>
        <p>
          Blockchain technology has a large potential to transform business operating models in the long term.
          Specific blockchain applications may be a disruptive innovation, because substantially lower-cost
          solutions can be instantiated, which can disrupt existing business models. Blockchain protocols
          facilitate businesses to use new methods of processing digital transactions. Examples include
          a payment system and digital currency, facilitating crowdsales, or implementing prediction
          markets and generic governance tools. Blockchains have the potential to reduce systemic risk
          and financial fraud
          <br /> As a distributed ledger, blockchain reduces the costs involved in verifying transactions,
          and by removing the need for trusted "third-parties" such as banks to complete transactions.

          Smart contracts
        </h3>
        <p>
          Blockchain-based smart contracts are contracts that can be partially or fully executed or enforced without
          human interaction. <br />Some blockchain implementations could enable the coding
          of contracts that will execute when specified conditions are met. A blockchain smart contract
          would be enabled by extensible programming instructions that define and execute an agreement.
          For example, Ethereum Solidity is an open-source blockchain project that was built specifically
          to realize this possibility by implementing a Turing-complete programming language capability
          to implement such contracts.
